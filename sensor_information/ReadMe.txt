Note:  At USCRN and ARS locations, precipitation is measured in mm. 
At these locations, the depth variable, z, is set to 5 (cm).

At SCAN locations, precipitation is measured in inches.  
The depth variable, z, is set to 2 (inches).

Models calibrated at USCRN locations are valid at SCAN sites if the precipitation series is converted
and vice-versa.
